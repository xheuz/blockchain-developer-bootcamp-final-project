## Description

### What is this project about?

A decentralized Trust or Will application that will work as a Trustee.

### Why building this project?

Currently we lack options to leave our digital assets to our loves ones. Decentralization enables a use case for creating a way to actually transfer ownership of your digital assets without third parties involved in the process and in a secure way.

### How will this project work?

The project will have 3 roles:

- Testator: the person who creates and administrate the Trust or Will.
- Beneficiary: the person who receives the assets.
- Owner: it will only be able to update which is the custody fee that will be charged.

#### Workflow

1. Testator creates a Trust by filling in the address (Beneficiary) and the amount that will be transfer.
1. Testator will be able to see a list of trusts and to keep them locked a check-in before deadline expires is required.
1. Testator dies or it's unable to access the assets then Beneficiary can claim the assets when the deadline expires. (A small fee will be charged at release time.)

#### As testator, I can:

1. Connect with my wallet.
1. Create a Trust.
1. Configure a check-in frequency (no less than 30 days).
1. Do a check-in to update deadline.
1. Cancel the Trust and get back all assets.

#### As a beneficiary, I can:

1. Connect with my wallet.
1. View all Trusts that I can request funds from.
1. Request funds when available.

#### AS Owner, I can:

1. Set custody fee that will be charged at release time.
